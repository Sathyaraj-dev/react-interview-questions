# <h2>React Interview Questions</h2>

**React Fiber vs Reconciliation:**

🚀Reconciliation is an algorithm that React.js uses to differentiate one tree from another to determine which parts need to be changed. Basically, it keeps track of UI and data layers when there is diff in both layers react using virtual DOM and updates the changes by re-rendering the specific component.

🚀React Fiber is used to increase React's suitability for areas like animation, layout, and gestures. Its headline feature is incremental rendering: the ability to split rendering work into chunks and spread it out over multiple frames.
Basically, react fiber is an architecture that splits the work and updates the only component that needs to change.

React Components can add styling in the following ways:

<ul><li>Add the Global Styles to the “index.html” File</li>
<li>Create a Style for Each Individual Component</li>
<li>Adding Inline Style to React Component Elements</li>
<li>Attach style property to JavaScript Style Object</li></ul>
